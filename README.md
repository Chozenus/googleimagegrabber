==================

Image grabber for google images

Well, hopefully you will eventually see a google image grabber, basically how it will work:

1. Type a search in to the box
2. Computer grabs the first search result
3. Computer runs raw image link through bit.ly or is.gd 
4. Computer outputs link, gives to the user, and displays the image on the page.

not even sure if this would work, just learning the basics of PHP now ;p
